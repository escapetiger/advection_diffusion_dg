# AdvectionDiffusionDG
This repository shows examples for solving linear advection-diffusion equation by the implicit DG method. 

Currently, codes for numerical examples with periodic boundary conditions are fully optimized via vectorization. In the next step, we will consider Dirichlet boundary conditions and other complex boundary conditions.
