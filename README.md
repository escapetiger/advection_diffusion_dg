# AdvectionDiffusionDG
This repository shows examples for solving linear advection-diffusion equation by the implicit DG method. 

Currently, codes for numerical examples with periodic and Dirichlet boundary conditions are fully optimized via vectorization.

Multi-step methods are used in time discretization. The diffusion term is discretized by local DG method. The advection term is discretized by either upwind Eulerian method or Semi-Lagrangian method.

Diagonal implicit Runge-Kutta algorithms are going on.
