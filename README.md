# AdvectionDiffusionDG
This repository shows examples for solving linear advection-diffusion equation by the implicit DG method. 

Currently, codes for numerical examples with periodic and Dirichlet boundary conditions are fully optimized via vectorization.

Diagonal implicit Runge-Kutta algorithms are g
